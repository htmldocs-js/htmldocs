Creating multiple invoices is as simple as passing different customer information through props. Here's how you can generate a new invoice by updating the customer details:

```tsx
<Invoice 
  customer={{
    name: "John Doe",
    address: "456 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "12345",
    phone: "123-456-7890",
  }}
  items={[
    {
      name: "Website Development",
      description: "Frontend implementation with React",
      price: 2000.00,
      quantity: 1
    },
    {
      name: "UI/UX Design",
      description: "Custom design system creation",
      price: 1500.00,
      quantity: 1
    }
  ]}
/>
```
