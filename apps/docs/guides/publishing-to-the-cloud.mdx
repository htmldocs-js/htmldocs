## Prerequisites

First, ensure you have the latest version of the htmldocs CLI installed:

```bash
npm i -g htmldocs@latest
```

This command installs or updates the CLI globally on your system.

## Authentication

Before publishing, you'll need to authenticate with the htmldocs cloud platform:

```bash
htmldocs login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can:
1. Select your team
2. Complete the authentication process
3. Store your credentials securely for future use

## Publishing Templates

Once authenticated, you can publish your document templates using the `publish` command:

```bash
htmldocs publish ./documents/templates/Invoice.tsx
```

<Note>
Make sure your template has a unique `documentId` defined before publishing:

```tsx
Invoice.documentId = "invoice";
export default Invoice;
```
</Note>

## Generating Documents via API

After publishing, you can generate documents using the REST API. First, obtain an API key from the [Dashboard](https://htmldocs.com/dashboard).

### API Authentication

Include your API key in requests using the Bearer token format:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
API keys are scoped to your team and provide access only to documents owned by that team.
</Note>

### Making API Requests

To generate a document, send a POST request to the generation endpoint with your document variables:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.htmldocs.com/api/documents/{documentId} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "variables": {
      "customerName": "Acme Corp",
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "Premium License",
          "quantity": 1,
          "price": 999.00
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Replace `{documentId}` with your template's document ID (e.g., "invoice").

## Managing Published Templates

You can view and manage your published templates in the [Dashboard](https://htmldocs.com/dashboard), where you can:

- View all published templates
- Get document IDs
- Manage API keys
- Monitor usage
- View generation history
