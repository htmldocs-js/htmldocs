## Automatic Setup
The easiest way to setup htmldocs is to use our automatic setup script.
1. Run the following command in your terminal:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash bun
bunx htmldocs@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

This will prompt you for your project name and create a new folder in your current directory.

3. After switching to the folder, you can start the development server by running:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash bun
bun dev
```

</CodeGroup>

This will start a live preview of your documents in your browser.

## Manual Setup
If you prefer to set up htmldocs manually, follow these steps:

1. Install htmldocs in your project:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash yarn
yarn add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash bun
bun add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "npx htmldocs@latest dev",
    }
}
```

3. Create document template

Create a new folder called `documents` in your project. Then, create a new file called `index.tsx` in the `documents` folder and include the following code:

```tsx
import { Document, Page } from "@htmldocs/react";

export default function MyDocument() {
    return (
        <Document size="A4" orientation="portrait" margin="0.5in">
            <Page style={{ backgroundColor: "#000", color: "#fff" }}>
                <h1>Hello from the dark side</h1>
            </Page>
        </Document>
    );
}
```

4. Run the development server by running:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash bun
bun dev
```

</CodeGroup>

This will start a live preview of your documents in your browser.
