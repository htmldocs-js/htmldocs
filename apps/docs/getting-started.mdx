## Automatic Setup
The easiest way to setup htmldocs is to use our automatic setup script.
1. Run the following command in your terminal:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash pnpm
pnpx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx htmldocs@latest init
```

```bash bun
bunx htmldocs@latest init
```

</CodeGroup>

This will prompt you for your project name and create a new folder in your current directory.

3. After switching to the folder, you can start the development server by running:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash bun
bun dev
```

</CodeGroup>

This will start a live preview of your documents in your browser.

## Manual Setup
If you prefer to set up htmldocs manually, follow these steps:

1. Install htmldocs in your project:
<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash yarn
yarn add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

```bash bun
bun add htmldocs @htmldocs/react @htmldocs/render
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "npx htmldocs@latest dev",
    }
}
```

3. Create document template

Create a new folder called `documents` in your project. Then, create a new file called `Book.tsx` in the `documents` folder and include the following code:

```tsx
import { Document, Footer } from "@htmldocs/react"
import MarkdownIt from 'markdown-it'

import "~/index.css"

const MARKDOWN_CONTENT = `
# The Art of Programming

## Chapter 1: Fundamentals

Programming is both a science and an art. It requires logical thinking and creative problem-solving. In this book, we will explore the principles that make software development a fascinating discipline.

### 1.1 The Programming Mindset

To become an effective programmer, one must develop a particular way of thinking. This includes:

- Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts
- Thinking algorithmically about solutions
- Understanding data structures and their applications
- Embracing continuous learning and adaptation

The journey of a programmer is one of constant growth and discovery.

const md = new MarkdownIt({ html: true })

function Book() {
  const html = md.render(MARKDOWN_CONTENT)
  
  return (
    <Document size="6in 9in" orientation="portrait" margin="0.75in">
      <article className="prose max-w-none font-serif">
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: html }} />
      </article>

      <Footer 
        position="bottom-center"
        className="font-serif text-sm"
        children={({ currentPage }) => currentPage}
        marginBoxStyles={{
          marginBottom: '0.25in',
        }}
      />
    </Document>
  )
}

Book.documentId = "book"

export default Book
```

4. Run the development server by running:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```

```bash bun
bun dev
```

</CodeGroup>

This will start a live preview of your documents in your browser.
